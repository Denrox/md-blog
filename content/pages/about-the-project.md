## Project Idea

This project demonstrates how to build modern content websites using Markdown files as the primary content format. The platform allows you to create and manage blog posts and static pages by simply adding `.md` files to the content directory.

The goal is to provide a simple, file-based approach to content management that's perfect for developers, writers, and anyone who prefers working with Markdown over complex CMS systems.
